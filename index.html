    <h1>Welcome to the multiverse of Tejal</h1>
    <h2>You would think these are different tejals from different worlds but actaully its the same person. You'd be amazed just get to the end!</h2>
    <h3>1. Model</h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/2.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>So as we can see this is probably the prettiest person u might have seen in your life. Not much to describe here its just self explanatory</p>
    <h3>2. Wizard</h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/3.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Ms Pancholi is actually a wizard or believes herself to be cause she cant really escape the Harry Potter world. But I'm starting to believe that she actually might be one cuz she makes me feel some unexplanable feelings with her stupid ass dark magic</p>
    <h3>3. Comic</h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/4.JPG" alt="">
    <p>HAHAHAHA. This one's a joke. Rarely funny hone ko comic ni bolte but we'll give it to her cuz its her bday </p>
    <h3>4. Photographer</h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/5.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>No jokes but this is the only real skill this woman has and is quite arrogant about it too. But well who're we kidding ,anyone would be if its the only skill they have. Right?(Ly)</p>
    <h3>5. Dayan </h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/Hitler.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>DO NOT FKN MESS WITH HER!!!</p>
    <h3>6. Care taker</h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/Care.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Tejpal is the most caring person on planet Earth. Here is the proof- her taking care of me (uk cuz im the GOAT). Hahaha</p>
    <h3>7. Pink Polar Bear</h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/Pink.jpeg" alt="">
    <p> She's probably a lost soul. So lost that maybe even forgot her real continent. But her new family is taking care of her like their own. Hope she's doing well in the tropical climate of India. I'm sure she doesnt miss her real home. </p>
    <h3>8. Bonus Point </h3>
    <img class="coverpage" src="./bday/image-removebg-preview.png" alt="">
    <p>In a parallel universe if she was non-living she'd look exactly like this. But in our universe she's  kind of a living form of this.  </p>
